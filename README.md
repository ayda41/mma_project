Welcome to EasySplit!

To use the app, please follow the given procedure:
1. Download all the files from Github and copy all of them in a folder.
2. Download the script of the app(EasySplit.py), and the data project_database.dat, user_database.dat and user_login.dat and put them inside a folder.
3. Run EasySplit.py
4. Please sign up if you don't have an existing account.
5. Record Transactions by:
a. Sign In
b. Main Menu->Myledger->Add a New Transaction(personal)
c. Main Menu ->Create Project -> Add Transaction -> Confirm
6. Go to Analytics or Myledger page to review the changes

If you are the first person to start the app, you would not have anyone to split the expense with. Since we are really friendly students, we have already set our bots to be your friends since the start. This is done to make sure YOU NEVER FEEL ALONE !!!
*NOTE: Only users who have been signed in can be used as members of any project. Users who are not part of the database cannot be made part of the project.

This app allows you to create project with your friends and track the expenses of each project.
It will give you the balance of each participant (negative amount means the user owe to the group, positive means the user is owed by the group). Every user is this application on your terminal is a friend of yours.

We have also created save suggestions, track expense functions at the back-end and because of shortage of time, we were not able to add it to the front end. You can check the following functions on lines (101-119) and (122-135) 

Moreover, you can track your own expenses by accessing the My Ledger page. 
This version is still a work in progress. If you want to use it with several accounts, it must be run on the same machine. Due to the lack of time, the databases are stored locally and the application runs on a single machine.

I hope you enjoy the application. If you don't then you can definitely uninstall
Thank You
